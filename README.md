# Introduction to Java for Android Development, LiveLessons

This contains the source code used in Introduction to Java for Android Development, LiveLessons. The video lessons are intended for absolute beginners with zero programming experience. They're available on [InformIT](http://www.informit.com/store/introduction-to-java-for-android-development-livelessons-9780134593951) and [Safari](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/introduction-to-java/9780134593968/) (ISBN: 9780134593951).

The code is split into two projects. The first project is "MySimpleProject," which contains code that was developed during the initial video lessons. The second project is "PlanetsApp," which was developed during the later video lessons.
